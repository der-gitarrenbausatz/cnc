# pre-commit Hooks

The starter kit uses the [pre-commit tool](https://pre-commit.com/) to configure hooks to run before a git commit.

To install `pre-commit`, follow the steps in the docs linked above.

Within the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the root of this repo, you can further configure the tool.
